These are instructions for using Velodyne_ICD and changing its content in order to use it as a plugin:

Velodyne_ICD folder contains 3 directories:
1. include - contains "h" files of the ICD
2. src - contains "cpp" files of the ICD
3. wrapper - h and cpp files and "so" files to create the dynamic library plugin.

If you just want to USE the plugin:
1. Copy "libvlp*.so" files on "wrapper" directory to "/usr/lib" (you may need "sudo" before the command)
2. Run "sudo ldconfig"
3. Run the required program.

If you want to CHANGE to plugin:
1. Changes on the ICD itself:
	a. Make your changes (src/include directories)
	b. Run make on "src" folder
	c. Copy the compilation product (libvlpcommunication.so) to wrapper directory
	d. cd to wrapper directory
	e. Run "make" or "make clean all"
	f. Repeat 1-3 steps above (USE the plugin).
2. Changes on the ICD wrapper: do "d-f" steps above

NOTES:
1. If the compilation fails because the compiler doesn't find the "h" files - you may need to change the "include" path on the makefile itself
2. Tester.cpp, Tester.h, main.cpp are for debugging. they are not compiled with the ICD.
