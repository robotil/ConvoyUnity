					function changed from "FixedUpdate" to "Update". for this frameTime = 0.01f was added (experimental).
					"horizontalFOV = Time.fixedDeltaTime * 360.0f * RotateFrequency / SuperSample;" because we don't use FixedUpdate changed to : 
					"horizontalFOV = frameTime * RotationAngle * RotateFrequency / SuperSample;" 
					" ColumnsPerPhysStep = Mathf.RoundToInt(Time.fixedDeltaTime * RotationAngle * RotateFrequency / AngularResolution) / SuperSample;" changed to: 
					" ColumnsPerPhysStep = Mathf.RoundToInt(horizontalFOV / AngularResolution);"
